# JCN-Traveling-Wave-Pathways
This code is meant to recreate results from the paper "Neuronal Traveling Waves Form Preferred Pathways Using Synaptic Plasticity" by Kendall Butler and Luis Cruz. It implements the BRIAN neural simulator to simulate traveling waves through a model neuronal tissue with Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP). This research was conducted through the Physics Department at Drexel University.

(CODE WILL BE POSTED UPON PUBLICATION OF THE ABOVE PAPER)
