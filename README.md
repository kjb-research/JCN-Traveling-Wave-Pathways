# JCN-Traveling-Wave-Pathways
This code is meant to recreate results from the paper "Neuronal Traveling Waves Form Preferred Pathways Using Synaptic Plasticity". It implements the BRIAN neural simulator to simulate traveling waves through a model neuronal tissue with Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP).
