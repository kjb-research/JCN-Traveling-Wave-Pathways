# Neuronal traveling waves form preferred pathways using synaptic plasticity - Reproducibility Code
## What is this for?
This code is meant to recreate results from the paper "Neuronal Traveling Waves Form Preferred Pathways Using Synaptic Plasticity" by Kendall Butler and Luis Cruz. It implements the BRIAN neural simulator to simulate traveling waves through a model neuronal tissue with Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP). This research was conducted through the Physics Department at Drexel University. If you can't find your way back to the original work, it is open access at https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10827-024-00890-2. 

For reference and debugging, the versions of various python modules used while putting together this research are below. If any issues or questions arise, feel free to email me directly at (kendall.butler.research@gmail.com), or email the corresponding author, Dr. Luis Cruz,
(CODE WILL BE POSTED UPON PUBLICATION OF THE ABOVE PAPER)
